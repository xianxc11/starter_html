        <h2>Swedish Pancakes</h2>

        <img src="images/swedish-pancakes-platted.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Tasty Swedish pancakes">
        <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li> Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.</li>
            <li> Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner.</li>
            <li>Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings.</li>
        </ol>
